# d9-upgrade_status-project

To better prepare for D9 I am rerunning my expertiment of checking everything for readiness.

See the project setup script for instructions on how I set up my environment.

Hit me up on drupal (mcdwayne) or midcamp slack (dwaynemcdaniel) for questions and for the needed CSV, which I am coordinating through google sheets.


to use lando, do this:

1.`lando start` to build the environment

2.`lando serve` to start the Drupal server

3. drop the csv into the project's web folder (or modify the script to point where you like)

4. `chmod +rx *.sh` to make sure the script has permissions

5. check local permissions to make sure others can write to your 'reports' file

6. add settings.php hash salt changes to git and commit

7. time for one one more final `git commit -am 'ready to roll'`

8. Now that In a new terminal tab, cd to the project then lando check to start.

Huge props to @AaronFeledy for the love and crating the Lando bits
