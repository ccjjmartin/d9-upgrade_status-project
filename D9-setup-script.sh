## VERY IMPORTANT STUFF
##
## Make sure this is true on ubuntu: 'sudo apt-get install php php-curl php-gd php-mbstring php-sqlite3' 
## might need another lbrary but I forgot to document as I went...
##
## 1. composer installed Drupal 8 with `composer create-project drupal/recommended-project my_site_name_dir`
## see: https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies
##
## 2. installed and started a server with `php ./core/scripts/drupal quick-start demo_umami`
## see: https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/install/drupal-8-quick-start-command
##
## 3. Make sure I have this .csv in place https://github.com/mcdwayne/d9-drupal-check-allthemodules/blob/master/modulelistmachinenames.csv AND the checkall script in place
##
## 4. SUPER VITAL!!!  Fresh installs harden permissions and will not let you rewrite the needed .yml file to let composer work(which is good for prodction, bad for local dev) 
## run `chmod u+w web/sites/default` to fix this.
##
## 5. `composer require drush/drush` (I have drush watcher launcher installed too, makes it easy, 
## see: https://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/)
##
## 6. `composer require drupal/upgrade_status`
## This is the tool that needs an active running Drupal site from what I could see.  
##
## 7. Modify the '/modules/contrib/upgrade_status/src/Commands/UpgradeStatusCommands.php' to enable the `upgrade_status:checkstyle` command
## I am using the update from GÃ¡bor Hojtsy (@goba) as found here: https://git.drupalcode.org/project/upgrade_status/blob/8.x-2.x/src/Commands/UpgradeStatusCommands.php
## `curl https://git.drupalcode.org/project/upgrade_status/-/raw/8.x-2.x/src/Commands/UpgradeStatusCommands.php > web/modules/contrib/upgrade_status/src/Commands/UpgradeStatusCommands.php ``
##
## 8. `drush pm:enable upgrade_status -y`(Super important to make drush upgrade_status:checkstyle work)
##
## 9. git init, add, commit and we should be ready to go.. should be...
## I called my repo 


## what should we call this one?

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
	echo -n "Name your post as a single dash-connected-string, leave off the suffix please:  " && read SITENAME
else  
	SITENAME=$1
fi


## Composer install the site
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project ${SITENAME}

## cd
cd ${SITENAME}
